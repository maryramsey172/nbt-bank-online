                <p> What are savings interest rates? These are payments made by the bank to you for leaving your money in the bank. By depositing your money in the bank, your bank utilizes a portion of it in its loan operations where it subsequently earns through interest and loan charges. </p>
                <p>In effect, the income they receive trickles down to you, their source of money. This savings interest rate is actually an effective incentive system. </p>
                <p>Why so? If you save more money in your bank account through your deposits and savings, you end up receiving a higher return on the savings interest rate than other people would. </p>
                <p><em>Banks have a threshold amount for you to be able to participate in the bank’s long-term, higher yield savings schemes. </em></p>
                <p><em>Time-deposit accounts, mutual funds and the like require you to leave your money untouched for a longer period of time. In exchange for the bank’s use of your money for a longer period of time, the percentages of interest return are double those that you would get in a regular savings account. </em></p>
                <p><em>You can add increments of a certain amount in order to increase the capital you invest in your time-deposit account or mutual fund. An increased account obviously translates to bigger interest gains. </em></p>
